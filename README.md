## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a cloned copy of my project [Eat-Da-Burger App on GitHub Repo](https://github.com/habibtaghavi08/Eat-Da-Burger.git) up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need:

* Code editing [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/)
* Work bench ui [MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/workbench/en/)

```Open your Code editing software
Open your Code editing software (example Visual Studio)

Open the "Terminal" in studio
perform a git clone from my... [Eat-Da-Burger App on GitHub Repo](https://github.com/habibtaghavi08/Eat-Da-Burger.git)
```

### Installing

After the files have been cloned into your Studio, you would need to perform the following

* "Save Workspace AS" to have a workspace to come back to.
* Next you will need to install your code's Dependencies
* This will capture all the items in your package.json file

See below on how to perform the install the apps Dependencies required for proper operation

```Dependencies
npm i
```

Next open MySQL and create a new "connection"

* Create a user name
* Set up a pass word

Now you will create your own .env file in the root folder and enter the following info.

```DotENV File
   DBhost = "localhost"
   DBuser = "root" or your username
   DBPass = "root" or your pass word chosen

```

Now go into the (/db/schema.sql) and (db/seeds.sql) files and copy the information and enter into your workbench.
Be sure to run the code to create your DB (data base) and Tables. Then on the seeds file, run that code to create the usable information.

## Running the server

Now you will want to run the web site locally.

### Right Click your server.js file and OPEN in Terminal

This will open your terminal in your "Root" folder and allow you to run the server "you may have done this already to get your  "npm i " completed

```node server.js
  node server.js
```

### You should now see the serving running

click on the link to open your web browser "localhost"

```Server
    Server listening on: http://localhost:8000
```

## Deployment

App was deployed with [Heroku](https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps)
